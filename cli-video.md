## cli-video

github repo - https://github.com/reckoner165/cli-video
- has tickets in there

### medium-term goals:
- write a blog post about it, share with video-dev folks
- perform an AV show with it
- chinatownjs???
- use it as a portfolio project

#### early june 2025
- fixed the ref issue that was causing player states to poorly transition between mp4 and m3u8 videos
- got video piped into canvas, with room to add a shader in the pipeline

TODO: (some of these are tickets in the repo as well)
- move react-terminal into this project for greater control
- add "fullscreen" feature that overlays code on top of the video a la Hydra
- add support for loading internet-archive videos
- add support for caching things beforehand (for local use)

#### circa October 2024
- Presented at NYC video tech meetup. There was some interest.
- Showed this to Rob Walsh at Demuxed. He seemed excited as well

#### original idea
- create a web-based video player that can only be interacted with via the commandline.
