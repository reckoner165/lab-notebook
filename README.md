# lab-notebook
a repo with running notes on my various projects, side projects and side side projects.

I'm currently spread thin and at risk of losing track of all the ideas I have, projects in flight. My brain travels faster than anything else I know, and this is Not Always a Good Thing(TM). This is a cache.

This is my effort at building an inventory with notes on where things are, and a rough oral history of how they came along.
