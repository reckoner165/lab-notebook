## DSP Redux


this is a very general hardware project idea that i want to do get back into hardware work and jog my memory on DSP from school

Even before I do the DSP-pico project listed below, I want to do the following:
1. Order some kit pedals / synths from online and simply assemble them. Get better with soldering. Perhaps do it under supervision
idea: Go to NYCR craft nights, or Cutelab or somewhere else


## learning ideas from chatGPT

üß≠ Phase 1: Rekindle Intuition with Quick Feedback Loops
Start with interactive, high-feedback environments that let you hear and see the effects of DSP concepts.

Tools:
- Python + Jupyter Notebook with scipy.signal, numpy, and matplotlib

- Audacity or Spear (for visualizing audio)

- Pure Data or Max/MSP (drag-and-drop DSP programming)

- Replit, Observable, or Tone.js (for browser-based DSP in JS)

Activities:
- Load a WAV file, apply basic filters (butter, lfilter from SciPy), visualize the spectrum

- Compare low-pass vs high-pass vs band-pass filters by ear and by FFT

- Simulate aliasing and sampling effects (resample a sine wave)

- Tip: set up mini "missions" ‚Äî e.g., ‚ÄúMake a low-pass filter and show before/after plots and audio‚Äù ‚Äî to stay focused and motivated.

üß± Phase 2: Solidify Concepts with Purposeful Repetition
Now build some mental muscle around key DSP topics. With ADHD, it helps to treat these like puzzles or exercises ‚Äî bite-sized, varied, and goal-oriented.

Topics (Relearned Practically):
- Z-transforms & poles/zeros (visualize filter responses)

- IIR vs FIR filters

- Windowing, spectral leakage

- Butterworth, Chebyshev, Biquads (make plots + audio demos)

- Filter design by hand vs using tools

Resources:
- DSP First (book + labs)

- The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to DSP (free online)

- scipy.signal docs for practical examples

‚ö° Phase 3: Make It Real with Embedded/Realtime Systems
Here‚Äôs where your Rust/C background and interest in chips comes in.

Platforms:
- ESP32 or Teensy (has audio shield + DSP libraries)

- RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico) for low-level fixed-point work

- WebAssembly + AudioWorklets if you want browser-based real-time DSP

Tools/Frameworks:
- Rust DSP crates like biquad, fundsp, dasp

- Faust (generate C++, Rust, or WebAssembly DSP code)

- SuperCollider for testing sound DSP ideas interactively

Projects:
- Write a fixed-point biquad filter for Teensy or Pico

- Build a noise gate, tremolo, or distortion effect in real-time audio

- Simulate analog filters digitally and compare their character

## PROJECT!

Goal: A real-time noise gate with threshold controlled by a potentiometer, running on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), written in Rust.

### tech:

- Microcontroller: Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
- Language: Rust (via rp-hal)
- DSP Frameworks:
- microfft for spectral features if needed
- Or implement gating logic manually with moving average, RMS, etc.
- Audio Input/Output:
- Use an I2S ADC/DAC (like PCM5102 or TLV320AIC3206)
- Or piggyback on a Teensy Audio Shield (works with 3.3V logic and I2S)
- Potentiometer: Read via onboard ADC pin for real-time threshold tuning

### DSP

A basic noise gate works like this:

```
If envelope(audio_frame) < threshold:
    output = 0
else:
    output = audio_frame
```

Enhancements:

- Envelope detection via RMS or peak hold
- Hysteresis or hold time to avoid chattering
- Attack and release time smoothing

You can model it in Python first to hear and visualize the effect, then port to embedded.
